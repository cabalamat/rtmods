## Instructions

To use this mod, first make sure you don't have a game in slot 6; resetting
with the Rtmods `--reset` option will achieve this.

Then install this mod.

Lastly install the mod for the country and situation you want to play. 
This will install the game start position in slot 6. The mods for each country 
are of the form:

    hist1922_{country}_{situation}

Country names are one of:

* france, germany, italy, japan, uk, usa, ussr

Situations are one of:

* (empty) = no Washington Naval Treaty, no Versailles Treaty
* w = Washington Naval Treaty, no Versailles Treaty
* v = no Washington Naval Treaty, but there is a Versailles Treaty
* wv = Washington Naval Treaty, and Versailles Treaty

So an example of a full country/situation mod name might be:

    hist1922_germany_wv
    
This means playing as Germany with the Washington Naval Treaty and the 
Versailles Treaty both in effect.

Or:

    hist1922_japan
    
Which means playing as Germany with no Washington Naval Treaty and no 
Versailles Treaty.
