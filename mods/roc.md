Kongxinga [writes](https://nws-online.proboards.com/post/47945) of the mod:

Thematically this nation is a sleeping economic Giant, crippled severely at the start. It has a very small industrial base along with several weaknesses (meddling politicians, low education etc) However, it shares the rapid growth rate of the US, and one of its maluses, the undeveloped ship industry, goes away in a decade or two. It starts of with an Autocratic government, but I think I have it set to change to liberal democracy to reflect the relaxation of martial law.

Research advantages are Damage Control (due to extremely good damage control in the aftermath of Yalu), and machinery (making up for bad technology by substituting with lots of labor shoveling coal into boilers.), as well as the late game missile technology (alternate history take, justified as the Chinese did invent the first gunpowder based anti ship missile).

I had to make up naming conventions for ship types which did not have any ships historically (for example, China only had 2 pre dreadnoughts ever, so I had to make up a naming convention for BBs). For the rest, I pored over the list of Qing modernized naval lists, as well as the KMT list, although several gunship names now do double duty as destroyers. 

For Airplane manufacturers, I am proud that I went and dug up some original language sources to compile the list. None of it is made up, although at least one is alternate history (The Guangdong Flying Machines Corporation was the brain child of one of China's aviation pioneers, who unfortunately died in a test flight before he could set up the company. And obviously AIDC did not exist in the time period, but could have come early if things went well). I think I did a good job here for immersion, so we won't get the CSA experience of"Southern Star offers a new fighter" since all companies did exist or were on a drawing board.

For the set piece missions, look out for a Yalu River rematch at close ranges with Japan.
