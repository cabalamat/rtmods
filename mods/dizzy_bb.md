The stock 'IDes' (folder of templates located in your Data folder) Ship Design Templates are what the AI uses to build all the ships in the game. These templates are predicated upon having the Washington Naval Treaty in place and this is why the AI doesn't build large displacement ships because most of the IDes feature lower displacement ship designs. But what if your game never has such a treaty? The AI won't ever build large ships because there are no IDes templates for them. Not anymore!

What my mod will do: This mod will add or edit a total of 77 BB and BC Templates from 1920 to the end of the game that the AI Nations will use to build ships you normally wouldn't see in a stock game. In the absence of a treaty, the continued escalation of bigger caliber guns, thicker armor and larger ship displacement will continue unabated just as it would have been historically had there never been a Washington Naval Treaty. Ships like the historical Japanese Yamato, the USA's Montana, Germany's Plan Z designs, Russia's Sovetsky Soyuz and the French Alsace will all be able to be built by the AI, and many more. Whatever monstrous Battleship designs you may have made in past games, watch out! The AI can build them now too!
