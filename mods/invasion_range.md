The **invasion_range** mod increases the ranges at which invasions 
are possible. The purpose is to make invasions easier.

It does this by altering the due-dates for technologies in 
Amphibious Operations, in the file `ReasearchAreas2.dat`.

Here is a list of the data of each advance in the original and new
`ReasearchAreas2.dat` files:
