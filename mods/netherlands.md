ChangeLog:

V1.50: Comprehensive rewriting of the War Missions file to improve quality
of war missions and add more variety. More missions with Japan and the US
will take place in SE Asia and the Caribbean respectively. Fixed bug error
with ABC Islands where they start out under invasion. Also added coastal
defense artillery positions and a possession defined war mission for the
ABC Islands. Also added more coastal artillery positions to the Netherlands
near Rotterdam. Note: Only files altered were Mapdata file and War Missions
file.
