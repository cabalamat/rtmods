# CHANGES.md for Rtmods

New changes go at the end.

# 2020-Dec-22 - pick up list of mods from mod/ dir

Instead of the list of mods being hard-coded in `config.py`, pick it up from 
`mods/` instead.

Each mod needs a {MOD}.md file and a {MOD}/ directory.

--done.

# 2020-Dec-25 - historical 1936 start

Adding `hist1936` etc mods for a historical 1936 start.
