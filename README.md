# README.md for rtmods

**Rtmods** (for "Rule the mods") is a modification installer for 
Rule the Waves 2.

## Background

[**Rule the Waves 2**](https://nwswargamingstore.net/shop/ols/products/nws-rule-the-waves-ii)
(RTW2) is a wargame by NWS. In it, you are the commander of a navy of one of the world 
powers between 1900-1955. You can design ships, then fight those ships against the fleets
of other naval powers.

Some people have written modifications for RTW2. These mods can be fiddly to 
install involving massy faffing about with files. Rtmods aims to streamline the 
process.

## Dependencies

Rtmods requires Python 3.8 or later, plus a copy of Rule the Waves 2.
